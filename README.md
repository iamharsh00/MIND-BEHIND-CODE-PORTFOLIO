# MIND-BEHIND-CODE-PORTFOLIO
This is my personal portfolio website, highlighting my skills, projects, and achievements in full-stack development. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, it features a responsive design, project showcase, and a downloadable resume. Stay tuned for updates as I enhance its functionality with backend integration using Node.js
